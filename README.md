# nepali-english-translator
In this present global community, we can find people all around the world in a single platform
trying to communicate with their native languages despite having the problem of language gap.
This problem can be solved using Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing by building
a Machine Translator. Tackling the problem of the under resourced Nepali-English pair,
Transformer model is designed, provided with a dataset of 20,000 parallel corpus (Nepali-English)
to convert Nepali sentence; preserving the style, technical and grammatical norms to English
sentence. This transformer model gives an accuracy of 92.76%. In a nutshell this research tokens
were processed sequentially; a state vector is maintained that contains a representation of the input
Nepali data and converts it to English.
